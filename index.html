	  Well, this is not exactly the final version or something.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I have tried a lot of things (I think). But nothing really worked at the end. I don't know what the problem was. So, instead of simply spending my time figuring out what it was
	  , I decided to create a website. I don't have anything in particular here. I am just planning to test few things. This is more like a personal website. This is something that
	  I will be working on for quite some time in the future. Basically there won't be a final version. This is just a placeholder kind of message while I will be working on what 
	    exactly I am hoping to build.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I don't know much about GitHub Pages and I am not sure why I am selecting this platform because my thoughts about building a personal site was a bit different. Maybe I will 
	  just see where this takes me.
