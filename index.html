	  I am not really great at writing. But that does not mean I don't want to 
	  write. There are several opions available to write today, I even tried one
	   of them. I have written a couple of articles on Medium website. Since it 
	  was my first time writing, I wouldn't call it a success. But, it was 
	  something and I am happy that I tried.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Writing on Medium did not make a lot of sense to me. The reason I was 
	  writing or I want to write is not for people to read and get some value 
	  out of it. I would be happy if that is the case. But the reason I decided 
	  to write was just  because I wanted to write. So, when I ended up writing 
	  on Medium, I spent quite sometime going through the stats. That made me 
	  realise that it was not working and I stopped writing on Medium altogether.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Though I was okay with it at first, as time passed by that need for 
	  writing came back. So, I had to do something about it. That's when the 
	  idea of creating a personal site came to my mind. That's what I did when 
	  that idea popped in my head.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Creating my own site gives me a lot more freedom than using some other 
	  site. The problem last time was the stats. I spent a lot of time looking 
	  at it. The number of reads were less because it was the beginning. I 
	  understand that. But when I asked myself do I need that, the answer was 
	  clearly a no. I am not interested in the reads I get because that is 
	  not the reason I decided to write.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You need data when you are trying to perform better for whatever the 
	  reason might be. But this is not about performance for me. It is just the 
	  joy of writing. So, the only thing that really matters to me here is the 
	  frequency. The more frequently I am writing the better and that is all 
	  that matters.
	</p>
	<p>
	  When I created this site, I am just done with college and waiting for the 
	  work to start. So, I have some time on my hand. Writing more frequently 
	  should technically not be a problem. But once work starts that's when I 
	  have to question myself about how frequnent I am.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Basically, there are two things I am planning or want to write about. 
	  There are times where I just have these philosophical thoughts or some 
	  internal dialogue. Those momnets help me with gaining a different 
	  perspective. So, that's something I want to write about. The second thing 
	  being the projects that I work on. When I say "projects I work on" they
	  are not the actual professional work. That goes without saying for obvious
	   reasons. The thing I want to write about is my side projects like this 
	  site or something that I have been reading about.
	</p>
	<p>
	  My writings can be found in the blog section. There is no comment section 
	  because I am not exactly looking for those yet. It is more of read what 
	  you see and keep the thoughts to yourself. Unless you already have a way 
	  of contacting me then of course I will be open to talk about it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There is no concrete plan as to how often I will be writing. I am not 
	  interested in creating a newsletter as well. I will just write whenever I 
	  feel there is something to talk about. Making no comments and no stats 
	  option all the more suitable for my current perspective about writing.
